# appinfo-parser
a single file, small steam3 appinfo parser

## usage:
see: example.py, but tldr is just import parse_appinfo and give it a seekable stream

## special thanks
- ymgve - too many to list but most notably provided a few old appinfos and some of this code is based on their old code
- ben - VDF2 format stuff
- xPaw - modern format documentation at https://github.com/SteamDatabase/SteamAppInfo
